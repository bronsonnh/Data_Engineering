# Real-Time-US-Earthquake-App-and-Dashboard

Hello! Welcome to the repo for the earthquake app an earthquake dashboard I built and deployed. Please click [here](https://share.streamlit.io/bronsonnh/streamlit_repo/main/nick-app.py) if you would like to  view and use the app. 

The aim of this project is to provide a dashboard that can be used to learn about earthquake activity in the US between 2010 and the present. I intend to continue building this dashboard out, and examining trends in earthquake activity both in the US and potentially globally. I will also conduct other case studies like the one in this dashboard examining the trends around earthquake prevalance in Oregon. Please feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-h-bronson-2b2b9774/) if you would like to discuss further, or if you have suggestions as far as improvements, features, or case studies you would like to see added to the web app. 

This repo contains the following:
* A [slide deck](https://github.com/bronsonnh/Real-Time-US-Earthquake-App-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Data%20Engineering%20Powerpoint%20(1).pdf) explaining the purpose of this project and my process in putting it together
* The [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/bronsonnh/Real-Time-US-Earthquake-App-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Engineering%20Project%20Notebook.ipynb) where I processed and explored the data that I aquired from the USGS 
* A [writeup](https://github.com/bronsonnh/Real-Time-US-Earthquake-App-and-Dashboard/blob/main/Engineering_Writeup.md) that describes the design, data, algorithms, tools, and communications for this project.
