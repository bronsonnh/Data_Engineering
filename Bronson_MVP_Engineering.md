## MVP Earthquake Data Engineering

By Nicholas Bronson

I have ingested nearly 900,000 datapoints into SQL from USGS's database. Following aquisition, I cleaned the data, removing entries that were not valid, and have begun to design the features that will later be implemented on Streamlit. 

Please see below for the project workflow diagram:

One of the features will be the ability to compare the number of earthquakes recorded per year, sorted by level of magnitude. For example a user of the Streamlit app will be able to change view between a graph that looks like the first below and the second by adjusting a slider:
